# ✨ Rock Paper Scissors Final Solo Project ✨

## Rock, Paper, Scissors (Alien, UFO)
- Cohort 2205 Solo Project
- Contributors: Maia Cochran

## Overview
I built a website where the user can play rock, paper, scissors against a computer-generated player. There are both classic and spicy versions of the game for the user to choose a game type. This site also includes a point-counting system in which the page includes a feature where both the computer and the users victories are logged for the game session.

This project gave me an opportunity to practice planning and writing code using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript languages. In this project, I focused on a data model first approach, then leveraging more JavaScript to make the data model interact with the DOM. Moreover, I was able to use feedback from previous projects to grow my skills as a developer and showcase the knowledge I have earned throughout Mod 1.

Enjoy!

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Features
- A user will have the choice of playing a classic game, or the spicy version (where additional rules and characters such as an alien and a UFO are added).
- Once the version is selected, the user chooses their character to face the computer-generated character choice.
- The user will either win, lose, or tie, based on the rules of the game version chosen on the home page.
- When the round does not result in a tie, the score of the winner will be logged in the appropriate side of the screen, according to who won the round.
- After each turn, a message generates to alert the user who won and which tokens were chosen for both user and computer.
- After a few seconds, the message disappears and a new message indicates that the game is ready for another round!
- Scores for both players persist throughout game types.
- Scores can be reset for the user and computer by clicking the 'reset score' button.
- User can return to the home page to choose a new game version to play.
- Available for mobile or desktop play!
