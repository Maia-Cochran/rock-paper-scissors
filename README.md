# Rock Paper Scissors Final Solo Project

## Rock, Paper, Scissors (Alien, UFO)
Cohort 2205 Solo Project
Contributors: Maia Cochran

### Overview
I built a website where the user can play rock, paper, scissors against a computer-generated player. There are both classic and spicy versions of the game for the user to choose a game type. This site also includes a point-counting system in which the page includes a feature where both the computer and the users victories are logged for the game session.

This project gave me an opportunity to write HTML and CSS, and leverage JavaScript to both create a data model and interact with the DOM.

Additionally, I was able to use feedback from previous projects to grow my skills as a developer as well as showcase all that I have learned in Mod 1.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html).

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Features
A user will have the choice of a classic rock, paper, scissors game, or the spicy version which includes additional rules and characters such as an alien and a UFO. In either option, the user can choose their character to face the computer-generated character choice. Based on the rules of the game (displayed on the initial load page), the user will either win, lose, or tie. When the round does not result in a tie, the score of the winner will be logged in the appropriate side of the screen, according to who won the round.

### Possible Future Extensions
- Add a reset game button to the page when playing game
- Show the winning icon when the game is played
- Save and log scores for each opponent
- Make the game multiplayer between humans
- Have a login page and allow user to have an account
